Sitting down at my desk, I start to write my new blog post. In this post, I share some thoughts on what to consider when preparing data for the machine learning model.

## Missing data

In practice, the data won't be perfect. Some records might miss a few attributes and some attributes may not be available for most of the records. Although there are various techniques for missing value interpolation (the simplest way is to replace NaN by 0 or the median of that attribute). However, it is often more straightforward to simply drop attributes that have more than 80%, for example, missing values. For attributes that have fewer missing values, you can check if it is affordable to drop records with a missing value for that attribute.

## Training and Validation/Testing set

It is easy to randomly select a subset of data as a testing/validation set. However, people also want to test the model by data that is new to the model. For instance, if you want to validate a stock price predictor, you typically want to train the model with data before a certain date and test it with data after that date. To validate a model for user behavior prediction, you can train the model with data from some users and test it with another group of users.

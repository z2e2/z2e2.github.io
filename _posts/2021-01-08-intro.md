Welcome to my humble website. *Docendo discimus*â€”"by teaching, we learn." I believe that running a personal homepage can help me keep track of my self-development progress. Also, by sharing on this website what I have learned, I can have a place to take notes and digest the new knowledge. More importantly, I hope I can contribute to the community through my blog posts.

## Background
It is a computational challenge for current metagenomic classifiers to keep up with the pace of training data generated from genome sequencing projects, such as the exponentially-growing NCBI RefSeq bacterial genome database. When new reference sequences are added to training data, statically trained classifiers must be rerun on all data, resulting in a highly inefficient process. The rich literature of "incremental learning" addresses the need to update an existing classifier to accommodate new data without sacrificing much accuracy compared to retraining the classifier with all data.

## Results
We demonstrate how classification improves over time by incrementally training a classifier on progressive RefSeq snapshots and testing it on: (a) all known current genomes (as a ground truth set) and (b) a real experimental metagenomic gut sample. We demonstrate that as a classifier model’s knowledge of genomes grows, classification accuracy increases. The proof-of-concept naïve Bayes implementation, when updated yearly, now runs in 1/4th of the non-incremental time with no accuracy loss.

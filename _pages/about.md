I’m a data scientist and bioinformatician with key talents in research, manuscript writing, and mentoring. I have successfully developed efficient machine learning algorithms to uncover hidden signals in genomic data and text data over the past 6 years. I am experienced in meeting tight deadlines, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and communicating data-driven solutions to a wide variety of stakeholders.        

In my graduate studies, I’ve taken on various leadership roles, including instructing undergraduate courses/laboratories, mentoring undergraduate/graduate research assistants, and coordinating cross-disciplinary research projects. I was awarded the Research Excellence Award and Teaching Assistant Excellence Award by the Drexel Graduate College for my exemplary commitments to innovative research and student learning.
